    "description": "Colleagues at the police station have testified that even though the doors and windows of the interrogation room were open during the interrogation, the room remained relatively quiet. This allowed them to overhear conversations and confessions from inside. They clearly stated that on the day of the interrogation, C0005 did not subject C0002 to any harsh interrogation or torture.",
